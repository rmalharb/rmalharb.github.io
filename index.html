I  work towards a future where disabled people have agency and control over their data.

                <p>
                   My work draws from disability studies to understand and resolve the harms of AI-enabled privacy techniques in various stages of AI development (i.e., from problem formulation, dataset creation, to end-user interaction). <a href="data/privacyBLV.pdf">Through in-depth qualitative research with Blind communities</a>, I argue that while such ‘state-of-art’ visual privacy approaches offer increased autonomy, they also raise significant concerns related to cultural representation (e.g., will these systems to be inclusive of the privacy needs of Blind people all over the world?) and trust (e.g., how would Blind people people confirm the accuracy of outputs by computer vision models?). In future work, I’m researchering how to address such tradeoffs through co-desgin workshops with Blind people.

            In addition to independent research, I enjoy vibrant and collaborative environments.

        <p>We interviewed 21 professionals with disabilities to unpack the accessibility dimensions of hybrid meetings. Our analysis demonstrates how invisible and visible access labor may support or undermine accessibility in hybrid meetings. We offer practical suggestions and design directions to make hybrid meetings accessible.</p>

        <p>Current assistive technologies (AT) often fail to support the unique needs of Blind people, so they often become domain experts, 'hack' and create Do-it-Yourself (DIY) AT to creatively suit their need. To further understand and support DIY AT, we conducted two-stage interviews and diary study with 12 Blind participants and we present design considerations for future DIY technology systems to support existing customization and ‘hacking’ behaviors Blind people develop.</p>

        <h3>Definition Drives Design: Disability Models and Mechanisms of Bias in AI Technologies</h3>

        <a href="https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/12903">First Monday DL</a> 
        <p>We reveal how AI bias stems from various design choices, including problem definition, data selection, technology use, and operational elements, alongside core algorithms. We show that differing disability definitions drive distinct design decisions and AI biases. Lack of transparency and disabled involvement exacerbate these issues. Our analysis offers a framework for scrutinizing AI in decision-making and promotes disability-led design for equitable AI in disability contexts.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Emerging Obfuscation Technologies in Visual Description Services for Blind and Low Vision People</h3>
        <p><u><strong>Rahaf Alharbi</strong></u>, Robin N. Brewer, Sarita Schoenebeck</p>
        <p><em>CSCW 2022</em></p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-aRxKsN6J8">Talk</a> 
        <p>Machine learning approaches such as obfuscation are often thought of as the state-of-art solution to addressing visual privacy concerns. We interviewd 20 Blind and low vision people to understand their perspectives on obfuscation. We found that while obfuscation may be benefical, it imposes significant trust and accessibility issues. Participants worried that cultural or gendered privacy needs might be overlooked in obfuscation systems. We applied the framework of interdependence to rethink current obfuscation approaches, and provided more inclusive design directions.</p>

        <a href="data/CSCW3555775.pdf">PDF</a>
        <p>We conducted a survey in 14 geographic regions around the world (N = 3,993) to understand women’s perceptions of harm associated with online harassment and preferred platform responses to that harm.  Results show that, on average, women perceive greater harm associated with online harassment than men, especially for non-consensual image sharing.</p>
